Note: I am a little bit older. Had a lot of jobs in my life.
Started out in the Air Force. Went to U Texas.
Had an IT job for 5 years. Then went to nursing school and 
had a career as a nurse since 2009. Wanted to contribute to 
healthcare in a different way, but not in management. Management
not for me. Want to contribute through software development
