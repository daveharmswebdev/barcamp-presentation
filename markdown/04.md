### .gitignore

At the very least I suggest these two entries in you .gitignore.

```
dist/bundle.js
node_modules
```

Note: 
+ when you are working with npm you always want to ignore your node_modules.
+ but you want to ignore your bundle for numerous reasons
+ it will be huge
+ and it will cause merge conflicts, it will always be different
  + every time you bundle
